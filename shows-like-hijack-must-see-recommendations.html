<time>10 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Apple TV+’s “Hijack” tells the tale of numerous hijackers seizing control of a plane and threatening the passengers, putting 200 lives in danger. Corporate negotiator Sam Nelson seeks to mediate the hijackers by entering their minds after becoming embroiled in a terrifying predicament. The suspense series follows hostages who are caught in life-or-death situations as they attempt to communicate with danger. It is a story of risk and survival that plays out in real time. It was created by Geroge Kay and Jim Field Smith, and it has a suspenseful storyline that unravels in a terrifying life-or-death scenario.</p><p>Idris Elba, Neil Maskell, Max Beesley, and Ben Miles all give strong performances that propel the film, which shows how common people band together to save themselves. The story connects the characters, from a regular negotiator to an egotistical passenger, as a group of bleeding hijackers cause chaos in the air. ‘Hijack’ has a number of engrossing themes that can keep you on the edge and has a ticking intensity that heightens the suspense. Therefore, if you enjoyed the compelling notion of a covert rescue planned by a collection of oddballs, you’ll find the shows on this list as fascinating. Several of these programmes, including “Hijack,” are available to stream on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, Hulu, or Amazon Prime.</p><h3>24 (2001-2010)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5d14d77852401.jpg alt="best plane hijack movies,hijack movies bollywood,best hijack movies hollywood,best hijack movies imdb,airplane hijack movies on netflix,plane hijacking movies based on true story,best hijack movies on netflix,plane hijack movies latest,shows like jack ryan,hijack based movies,movies based on hijack,hijack web series,shows like hip hip hurray,hijacking series,shows like jackson heights" width=512 height=384 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The protagonist of the programme is a counter-terrorism agent named Jack Bauer, who faces intense scenarios that can mean the difference between life and death while working against the clock. The agent discovers that the delicate balance of safety may not be as simple to restore as he races against time to foil terrorist schemes and protect his country from catastrophic events that could wreck it all. Similar to “Hijack,” the plot revolves around a sophisticated scheme hatched by a technocrat in an effort to protect his country from a variety of catastrophes. So, if you enjoyed the thriller that took place 1,000 feet above sea level, you’ll enjoy this action-packed thriller just as much.</p><h3>Departure (2019-2022)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Departure.jpg alt="best plane hijack movies,hijack movies bollywood,best hijack movies hollywood,best hijack movies imdb,airplane hijack movies on netflix,plane hijacking movies based on true story,best hijack movies on netflix,plane hijack movies latest,shows like jack ryan,hijack based movies,movies based on hijack,hijack web series,shows like hip hip hurray,hijacking series,shows like jackson heights" width=512 height=289 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘Departure’ explores the intriguing mystery of a passenger airliner that mysteriously disappears over the Atlantic Ocean and features another high-octane conspiracy as it develops. Investigator Kendra Malley needs to learn what happened to the plane and whether any survivors are still alive in order to unravel the <a href=#>mysteries</a> hidden within the conspiracy. The expert discovers that a single missing piece of the puzzle might make all the difference as the case comes to a close. The next show to see is Vince Shiao’s masterpiece, “Departure,” which stars Archie Panjabi, Christopher Plummer, and Kris Holden-Ried and exhibits the delicate balance of a crime thriller that develops with twists and turns around every corner.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u7ba48e5cb6c8fde4d3d400ad84bc6da0><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>8 Similar Shows Like That 90s Show You Can Watch This Weekend</span></a><h3>Flashpoint (2008-2012)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10-0566BD72-C9B9-4633-B6C4-818AE8F70474.jpg alt="best plane hijack movies,hijack movies bollywood,best hijack movies hollywood,best hijack movies imdb,airplane hijack movies on netflix,plane hijacking movies based on true story,best hijack movies on netflix,plane hijack movies latest,shows like jack ryan,hijack based movies,movies based on hijack,hijack web series,shows like hip hip hurray,hijacking series,shows like jackson heights" width=247 height=139 sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This distinctive series follows the exploits of a police tactical team operating in a Canadian city entrusted with freeing hostages, dismantling gangs, and risking their lives to save innocent victims. ‘Flashpoint,’ by writers Mark Ellis and Stephanie Morgenstern, delves into the complexities of hostage-taking and negotiating, and uses highly-skilled strategies that can do wonders. Enrico Colantoni, David Paetkau, Hugh Dillon, Sergio Di Zio, Michael Cram, and Mark Taylor are the show’s main actors. ‘Flashpoint’ also takes a closer look at the priceless skill of negotiating, just as ‘Hijack’ highlights the power of persuasion.</p><h3>Hostages (2013)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MV5BNTgxNjI0NjUyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM1MjAwMDE@._V1_-1.jpg alt="best plane hijack movies,hijack movies bollywood,best hijack movies hollywood,best hijack movies imdb,airplane hijack movies on netflix,plane hijacking movies based on true story,best hijack movies on netflix,plane hijack movies latest,shows like jack ryan,hijack based movies,movies based on hijack,hijack web series,shows like hip hip hurray,hijacking series,shows like jackson heights" width=400 height=267 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘Hostages’ also tells the tale of a technocrat who is forced to take on an unexpected role, much like the stoic negotiator who utilised his cunning to create a safety net. The drama, which is based on the Israeli television series of the same name, tells the tale of Ellen Sanders, a renowned thoracic surgeon who is sent to operate on the US President. Ellen, however, is forced to make difficult choices when her family is kidnapped in the middle of the night. A struggle to defend and save the hostages is present in “Hostages,” matching the time-ticking intensity of “Hijack.” The title character in the television series “Hostages,” played by Toni Collette, negotiates in a high-stakes scenario.</p><h3></h3><h3>Kidnap and Ransom (2011-2012)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/51951dd879a2e09d81cb79ff3c2b6db5be7a9df48992d4d3e20cf6f4337421b0._RI_SX720_FMjpg_.jpg alt="best plane hijack movies,hijack movies bollywood,best hijack movies hollywood,best hijack movies imdb,airplane hijack movies on netflix,plane hijacking movies based on true story,best hijack movies on netflix,plane hijack movies latest,shows like jack ryan,hijack based movies,movies based on hijack,hijack web series,shows like hip hip hurray,hijacking series,shows like jackson heights" width=360 height=203 sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Like “Hijack,” “Kidnap and Ransom” is a thriller that reveals the threats leading up to a terrible incident. The protagonist of the novel is hostage negotiator Dominic King, who is struggling with his issues while attempting to secure the release of innocent victims. Trevor Eve, Helen Baxendale, Natasha Little, Scott Sparrow, and Amara Karan are among the cast members. Similar to “Hijack,” the Patrick Harbinson work tells the tale of a negotiator who has to save the unwary victims trapped in a dire circumstance.</p><h3>Ransom (2017-2019)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ransom-1.jpg alt="best plane hijack movies,hijack movies bollywood,best hijack movies hollywood,best hijack movies imdb,airplane hijack movies on netflix,plane hijacking movies based on true story,best hijack movies on netflix,plane hijack movies latest,shows like jack ryan,hijack based movies,movies based on hijack,hijack web series,shows like hip hip hurray,hijacking series,shows like jackson heights" width=450 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Eric Beaumont, a man who gives his experience to navigate a number of high-stakes scenarios and rescue people caught in some of the most dangerous crimes in the world, is the star of this riveting series.

The television show covers every facet of a dangerous circumstance that twists the lives of those involved. The Day is the perfect series to binge after the 200 or so people that were forced into a position, as it also shows how far a hostage scenario can develop.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="best plane hijack movies,hijack movies bollywood,best hijack movies hollywood,best hijack movies imdb,airplane hijack movies on netflix,plane hijacking movies based on true story,best hijack movies on netflix,plane hijack movies latest,shows like jack ryan,hijack based movies,movies based on hijack,hijack web series,shows like hip hip hurray,hijacking series,shows like jackson heights" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
