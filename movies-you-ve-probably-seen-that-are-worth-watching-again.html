<time>03 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Since the advent of silent cinema, this art form has held the palm in popularity with most people. Many of us have favorite movies associated with memorable or pleasant memories. That’s why it makes us want to watch them repeatedly. After all, what could be better than a lovely evening spent watching a movie guaranteed not to deceive your expectations?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Everyone has their idea of enjoyable. However, in this review, we have tried to collect several films that have long become classics of American cinema. They will brighten your leisure time, even if you see them far from the first time.</span></p><h2><span>Top 5 Best Movies to Watch Again</span></h2><p><span>We present you a list of the worthiest films, in our opinion, which are fascinating to watch, not only for the first time. These are movies that, with each new viewing, open from an unexpected new side.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/movies-youve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again-01.jpg alt width=1125 height=750 sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span>21</span></h3><p><span>This is a 2008 American drama film. Robert Luketic directed it. The central character of the tape is a talented student who dreams of continuing his education within the walls of Harvard Medical School. But he needs more money to make his dream come true. The solution to the problem appears quite unexpectedly. Noticing the mathematical abilities of a young man, an MIT teacher makes him an offer that is hard to refuse.</span></p><p><span>As it turned out, the professor traveled around the country for a long time and successfully earned money in blackjack with several other peers of the protagonist. The guidance of an experienced mentor is bearing fruit this time as well. In a matter of months, young people become desperately rich. They beat gambling establishments for hundreds of thousands of dollars.</span></p><p><span>If you also love such popular card games as poker or blackjack, today, to play at the same table with a professional live dealer, you don’t even have to leave your home – just visit a </span><a href=#><span>live casino</span></a><span>. And who knows, maybe luck will smile on you too.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/movies-youve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again-02.jpg alt width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span>Ocean’s Eleven</span></h3><p><span>This </span><a href=#><span>American cult film</span></a><span> has two sequels – Ocean’s Twelve and Ocean’s Thirteen. The movie is one of the most famous films about a casino robbery. Here, the feature is also in the star cast: Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, and Andy Garcia.</span></p><p><span>According to the plot of the crime comedy, a charismatic criminal played by George Clooney, who has just exited prison, immediately starts training a team of professionals. He wants to turn into reality the most audacious plan in his life. He aims to rob a casino with a perfect security system and recapture his ex-wife from its vindictive owner.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/movies-youve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again-01.png alt width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span>Now You See Me</span></h3><p><span>The next is a spectacular comedy-drama with an unpredictable and captivating plot. Such stars of American cinema played notable roles as Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, and Morgan Freeman. The film is about several exceptionally talented young people who can perform magic tricks almost bordering on magic.</span></p><p><span>A mysterious stranger accompanies them to orchestrate an incredibly complex yet impressive scam. A year later, all four perform in Las Vegas and, under the admiring glances of the audience live, steal several million dollars from a bank located several thousand kilometers from the gambling capital of the United States.</span></p><p><span>As it turned out, the money from the bank disappeared, but federal agents have no explanation for this except for magical reasons. However, the down-to-earth investigator Dylan Rhodes, played by </span><a href=#><span>Mark Ruffalo</span></a><span>, who does not believe in miracles, decides to get to the truth at all costs.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/movies-youve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again-03.jpg alt width=960 height=540 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span>Rain Man</span></h3><p><span>A landmark film featuring some of the brightest stars of world cinema – Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise.</span></p><p><span>The plot is based on the story of two brothers. An autistic genius with mathematical abilities and a self-confident handsome man have nothing in common except blood relationships. However, fate brings them together.</span></p><p><span>A dramatic story about complex human relationships that deservedly received as many as four </span><a href=#><span>Oscars</span></a><span> and is an excellent choice for personal or family cinema viewing.</span></p><p><span>Groundhog Day</span></p><p><span>I want to end this list with a fantastic film. In it, the most cheerful comedian with a severe face, Bill Murray, the Hollywood beauty of the 1990s, Andie MacDowell, and, of course, the film’s protagonist, Phil the Groundhog, played their memorable roles.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/movies-youve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again-04.jpg alt width=1600 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>A lyrical comedy with deep overtones raises a thorny philosophical question – what exactly makes us real people? And the film confidently gives the only correct answer to it.</span></p><p><span>If you have long missed the kind, sweet, and even a little naive Hollywood films, it’s time to re-watch Groundhog Day.</span></p><p><span>The plot of the picture is built on a time loop in which an ambitious presenter of a small television channel finds himself. The hero, Bill Murray, is forced to live the same day repeatedly, which turns out to be the famous American holiday Groundhog Day.</span></p><p><span>To shoot a story about a fluffy predictor, the TV man is forced to go to a cozy, small town. Here he is surprised by the phenomenon of February 2, which repeats every day.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kurDCyJ6qZrGfqsOmec%2BrppuZkqHGbr%2FEnqVmrJiWwW6t0Z5ksKeiqbVuw8CtmqGhnpx6orPAoqVo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmovies-you-ve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmovies-you-ve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmovies-you-ve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmovies-you-ve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmovies-you-ve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmovies-you-ve-probably-seen-that-are-worth-watching-again.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nba-fans-troll-lebron-james-lakers-after-struggles-vs-rockets-without-anthony-davis-news-scores.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nba-fans-troll-lebron-james-lakers-after-struggles-vs-rockets-without-anthony-davis-news-scores.html>NBA Fans Troll LeBron James, Lakers After Struggles vs. Rockets Without Anthony Davis | News, Scores</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mistresses-season-finale-recap-find-out-who-murdered-luca-raines.html>Mistresses Season Finale Recap: Find Out Who Murdered Luca Raines</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mistresses-season-finale-recap-find-out-who-murdered-luca-raines.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
