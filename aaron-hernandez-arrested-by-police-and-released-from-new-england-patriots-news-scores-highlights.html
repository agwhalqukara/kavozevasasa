Words cannot express the disappointment we feel knowing that one of our players was arrested as a result of this investigation. We realize that law enforcement investigations into this matter are ongoing. We support their efforts and respect the process. At this time, we believe this transaction is simply the right thing to do.”</p><p>---End of update---</p><p>---Original Text---</p><p>New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was led out of his house this morning in handcuffs facing undisclosed charges.</p><p>Hernandez has been under investigation in connection with the murder of his acquaintance, Odin L. Lloyd, 27, whose body was found June 17 at an industrial park near Hernandez’s home.</p><p>It was not immediately known what charges Hernandez is facing.</p><p>Michael David Smith of Pro Football Talk provided a screen cap of Hernandez in handcuffs as seen on NFL Network:</p><p>Stanley Staco provided another photo of the tight end being led from his home:</p><p>Massachusetts State Police released more information on Aaron Hernandez.</p><p>Police arrived at Hernandez's North Attleboro, Mass., home on Wednesday morning, as captured by Kathryn Sotnik of NECN:</p><p>Jenny Wilson of the Hartford Courant was also able to snap a photo of police waiting at Hernandez's door before he ultimately answered:</p><p>Once Hernandez came to the door, he was handcuffed, arrested and taken away in a police cruiser:</p><p>Lloyd was seen out at a Boston bar with Hernandez and two other men on the night of his death, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MyFoxBoston</a>. Lloyd reportedly left in a car driven by Hernandez, and while Hernandez and the two other men returned to his home at the end of the night, Lloyd didn't.</p><p>The connections between Hernandez and Lloyd don't stop there as Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend, according to Peter Wilson of WBZ-TV in Boston.</p><p>Lloyd was a linebacker for the Boston Bandits of the New England Football League. He reportedly practiced with the team on the Saturday prior to his death, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Local</a> in Boston. While solving the mystery surrounding Lloyd's death is obviously the top priority, much of the focus has inevitably shifted toward Hernandez's status with the Patriots.</p><p>The Patriots begin their regular season on Sept. 8 on the road against the Buffalo Bills. Tight end Rob Gronkowski's status for that game is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still in question</a> due to a myriad of surgeries since the end of last season. Now it appears as though New England may be without Hernandez as well.</p><p>Despite missing six games due to injury last season, Hernandez was among the Patriots' most consistent pass catchers as he racked up 51 receptions for 483 yards and five touchdowns. Just one year earlier, Hernandez accrued 910 yards and seven touchdowns, so he is obviously a key part of the Patriots offense.</p><p>With New England already having&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lost wide receiver Wes Welker</a> to the Denver Broncos in free agency, their skill positions are wearing a bit thin. Quarterback <a href=#>Tom Brady</a> seems to produce regardless of whom he is targeting on his throws, but head coach <a href=#>Bill Belichick</a> certainly has to be concerned by these developments.</p><p>Even if Hernandez is ultimately found innocent in relation to Lloyd's death, his trouble with the law may not be over. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, Hernandez was sued by Alexander Bradley earlier in the month as he accused Hernandez of shooting him in the face following an altercation at a Miami strip club on Feb. 13.</p><p>According to the report, Hernandez and Bradley left the club in the same car. Hernandez allegedly aimed the gun at Bradley and it discharged, which resulted in Bradley being shot in the face. Bradley's lawsuit against Hernandez was reportedly dropped, but it was only due to an error in paperwork.</p><p>Hernandez is not currently a suspect in the Bradley shooting, but now that he has been taken into custody in relation to the death of Lloyd, it stands to reason that police will take a much harder look at Hernandez's possible involvement in the other case.</p><p>This promises to be a long and arduous process for Hernandez and everyone involved. However, it obviously doesn't reflect well upon the Patriots star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG9vaWiFcXnAmqmopl2dsrO6wKebnrJdqa6ssc1moKesn2Kwtr%2FTqJuyZZKuerG7y6KanmWZo3qprc2dmq6elqh6p77OpmShoaNitbC5xA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faaron-hernandez-arrested-by-police-and-released-from-new-england-patriots-news-scores-highlights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2faaron-hernandez-arrested-by-police-and-released-from-new-england-patriots-news-scores-highlights.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2faaron-hernandez-arrested-by-police-and-released-from-new-england-patriots-news-scores-highlights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2faaron-hernandez-arrested-by-police-and-released-from-new-england-patriots-news-scores-highlights.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faaron-hernandez-arrested-by-police-and-released-from-new-england-patriots-news-scores-highlights.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2faaron-hernandez-arrested-by-police-and-released-from-new-england-patriots-news-scores-highlights.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./albert-pujols-signing-with-dodgers-after-angels-release.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./albert-pujols-signing-with-dodgers-after-angels-release.html>Albert Pujols signing with Dodgers after Angels release</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./where-is-convicted-kidnapper-larry-hall-now.html>Where Is Convicted Kidnapper Larry Hall Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./where-is-convicted-kidnapper-larry-hall-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
