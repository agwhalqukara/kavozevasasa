<time>08 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Over the years, boybands have been known to be hugely popular, garnering huge fan bases who support them no matter what. From the days of New Kids on The Block, Take That, The Backstreet Boys, NSync, Boyzone, and Westlife, to the more recent reign of The Wanted, One Direction and JLS, there is a boy band out there who stole every girl’s heart.</p><p>One of the newest boy bands on the scene is The Fourth Kingdom. The band is made up of four guys – Sebastian, Shane, Kyle and Jaxon who all met when competing in Belgium’s edition of The Voice. They have been working hard on writing music and have just released their debut single “Broken”. The single offers something different from the typical boy band and is sure to be a hit.</p><h3>You can watch the official music video for “Broken” below:</h3><p></p><p>The Fourth Kingdom recently took time out of their busy schedules to chat with us about their debut single “Broken” and their plans for the future.</p><h4>Firstly, what made you all decide to follow a career in music?</h4><p>Kyle: I wanted to produce before singing, but when I started to make music my co producer always asked can you sing in the demo? Which I did and I liked it a lot :)</p><p>Sebastian: I knew I wanted to be a singer early on and my sisters inspired me to pursue a career, but it was when I received my first guitar that I really started to take it seriously</p><p>Shane: My brother sang and my parents encouraged me to do the same, help a brother out they said lol, so we started to perform together</p><p>Jaxon: My teammates at my soccer team said I sang really well :), under the shower you know.I really just started just before I entered in The Voice, to be honest, but I love to sing that’s for sure.</p><h4>Growing up, who were your musical inspirations?</h4><p>Sebastian: I Love John Mayer, his unique sound & guitar play is incredible, he was the one that made me pick up my guitar and start rehearsing.</p><p>Jaxon: Definitely Michael Jackson, he truly was the best of the best, and when I hear my manager Peter talking about his concerts, the performances he did, then I know that this is something I really want to work hard for to achieve.</p><p>Kyle: The first album I bought was X from Chris Brown and I love his music</p><p>Shane: I love all kinds of music and don’t really have one particular idol, although I really appreciate The Weeknd, his writing skills, his voice…all top notch!</p><h4>How did you choose a name for the band, and how did you decide what sound the band would focus on?</h4><p>Shane: We were actually called State Of Mind in the beginning until we started to see comments on Youtube that people were confusing us with another band with the same name. So just before the US release, we decided to change our name into The Fourth Kingdom.</p><p>Kyle: We try to bring our own sound, pop with urban music influences. We also love collaborating with other artists that bring something extra to our sound</p><h4>Can you tell us a fun fact about each other?</h4><p>Kyle: Well Jaxon and I grew up in the same town, we have been best friends for a long time, so my fact about him is that he really is a goofy guy, you better watch out or he pranks you multiple times.</p><p>Jaxon: It’s true I like to prank the other, but now that you went there Kyle, this is my fact about you… YOU ARE…hahahaha don’t worry I’ll be nice.</p><p>Kyle is somebody you can really depend on, it’s not the first time we forgot our wallet at home while being in a restaurant :) he is always the responsible one that makes sure we don’t screw up.</p><p>Sebastian: I know for a fact that Shane also wants to be an actor, he kinda got his first role in a very popular Belgian sitcom but our manager said nope, can’t do we are going to the US :)</p><p>Shane: Yeah that was a bummer for 5 minutes until I heard USA? Hahahaha</p><p>My fact is about Sebastian, he always wants to play Fifa but when he loses…hahaha</p><p>Sebastian: Fact I hate to lose with Fifa lol</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/exclusive-interview-with-new-boyband-the-fourth-kingdom-02-1024x682.jpg alt width=710 height=473 sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h4>We love your debut single “Broken”. Can you tell us about the inspiration behind the song?</h4><p>Jaxon: Last April we stayed in New York for about two months, recording different songs for our upcoming album.Ty Jamz, one of our producers played us the “Broken” instrumental and together with MJ Songstress (songwriter) we started writing to it.</p><p>Sebastian: The lyrics poured out of our heart, it was quite intense to create. “Broken” really strikes a chord with us and is a good representative of who we are as a band.</p><p>Shane: Broken is about&nbsp;the hurt of losing the one you love, the breaking up of that relationship.</p><p>Kyle: Indeed, you know your girl is cheating on you but you go through the motion of denial, sometimes the reality is too hard to deal with.</p><h4>Boybands have been known to be very successful over the years. As a relatively new band, what do you think makes you stand out from the boybands that have come before?</h4><p>Sebastian: We do not only sing, we all play instruments so that might be a difference. I play the guitar.</p><p>Kyle: I play the piano.</p><p>Shane: Drums</p><p>Jaxon: I also play the guitar, but I think the difference would be in sound. “Broken” for instance is not a typical boyband track.</p><h4>Your track ‘Always Need You’, features Flo Rida and your upcoming song ‘Ready Set Go’ features Nicki Minaj. How did these collaborations come about and what was it like to work with them?</h4><p>Shane: Our management knows people who worked with Nicky & Flo, we reached out to them and that’s how it started.</p><p>Sebastian: We know we are very fortunate to get these opportunities.</p><p>Jaxon and Kyle: We are very grateful for it.</p><h4>Talking about collaborations, are there any other artists you would like to work with in the future?</h4><p>Kyle: Chris Brown!</p><p>Sebastian: Justin Bieber!</p><p>Shane: The Weeknd 100%</p><p>Jaxon: Harry Styles, I love the new music</p><h4>What’s been your favourite memory as part of the band so far?</h4><p>Sebastian: It has really been a rollercoaster these past months/year but mine was coming to America.</p><p>Kyle: From competing on The Voice to having a career, it all went very fast. Right after The Voice, we got to perform in front of 17.000 people, that was epic.</p><p>Jaxon: Yes that one but also our acoustic performance on the Writer’s league in NY, the crowd was INCREDIBLE!</p><p>Shane: All the music stuff was epic, but meeting & talking to Trey Songz, the advice he gave us… that was so unreal</p><p>Jaxon/Kyle/Sebastian: True Shane, so many great opportunities!</p><h4>Can we expect an album from you anytime soon, and if so, what can we expect from it?</h4><p>Kyle: We recorded so many songs these past months, now it’s all about getting the right tracks released at the right time, but yes we can release an album!</p><p>Shane: You can expect more 4TK music soon!</p><p>Sebastian: All with a special 4TK touch :)</p><h4>Have you got a message for your fans?</h4><p>Jaxon: Yes, listen, like, follow and comment on all our socials and check our journey on our Youtube page, we are all doing it for you guys and we hope you’ll like it!</p><p>Sebastian: They will Jax they will :)</p><p>Kyle & Shane: In The Fourth Kingdom our fans are the Kings & Queens!</p><h4>What plans do you have for the rest of 2017 and onwards?</h4><p>Kyle: We are going on a tour across the states at the end of September and promote our new songs, we will also do fashion week in London.</p><p>Sebastian: Connecting with the fans on social media on a daily basis :)</p><p>Jaxon: Showcase all the songs we recorded these last months.</p><p>Shane: Can’t wait for the fans to hear them!</p><h4>Thank you so much to Kyle, Shane, Sebastian and Jaxon for taking the time to chat with us.</h4><p>To keep up to date with The Fourth Kingdom you can follow them on their <a href=#>Twitter</a> or <a href=#>YouTube.</a></p><h4>Finally, don’t forget to share your thoughts on our interview with The Fourth Kingdom by tweeting us at&nbsp;<a href=#>@CelebMix</a>.</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksrmvy66qoq6VYravwMSrraKdp2K7psOMm6aympGjsW6yzq6praBdoLavs8OopGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-interview-with-new-boyband-the-fourth-kingdom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fexclusive-interview-with-new-boyband-the-fourth-kingdom.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-interview-with-new-boyband-the-fourth-kingdom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fexclusive-interview-with-new-boyband-the-fourth-kingdom.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-interview-with-new-boyband-the-fourth-kingdom.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-interview-with-new-boyband-the-fourth-kingdom.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./inside-the-stanley-hotel-that-inspired-the-shining.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./inside-the-stanley-hotel-that-inspired-the-shining.html>Inside The Stanley Hotel That Inspired 'The Shining'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alyssa-kulani.html>Alyssa Kulani</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alyssa-kulani.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
