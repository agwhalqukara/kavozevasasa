When the series first premiered in 2017, it appeared to be about several families in a small German town trying to find two small children who went missing. What the families discovered, to their surprise, was a wormhole which lurks beneath the town’s nuclear power plant and takes them back and forth between past, present, and future.</p><p>The families learn how they are mysteriously all connected, and, led by our main protagonists Jonas and Martha, they discover the purpose of the wormhole which was originally used to prevent tragedy from occurring. Eventually it festered into an apocalyptic time loop, as portals are wont to do, that they must find a way to stop.</p><p>Hailed for its intelligence and satisfying conclusion, Dark veered into completely fantastical science fiction territory while keeping the emotional stakes high. If you miss the series and want to find something similar that will feed your appetite for travel to alternate dimensions, multiverses, or just small towns with big secrets, we’ve got you covered. Here are seven shows like Dark that you can watch on Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.</p><p><span class=item-number><span class=number-wrapper>1</span></span> <span class=item-heading-bg></span></p><h2 class=article-list__heading>‘Stranger Things’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/Netflix_Dark.jpg><p>Netflix’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Stranger Things</a> also involves a group of small-town kids trying to solve the mystery of a mysterious portal to another world, this one called The Upside Down. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends try to find out where he is. His mother, played by Winona Ryder, and the local police chief played by David Harbour, are the adults they can trust to help, and eventually they venture into the twisted, bizarro world that’s been swallowing kids and housing Demagorgons. Oh, and along the way, they meet a young girl named Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) who’s running from government agents who have been doing experiments on her thanks to her having supernatural powers.</p><p><a href=# class=article-list__stream-link rel=noopener>Where to Stream Stranger Things<br></a></p><p><span class=item-number><span class=number-wrapper>2</span></span> <span class=item-heading-bg></span></p><h2 class=article-list__heading>‘Loki’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/247newsaroundtheworld.com/news/7-shows-like-netflixs-dark/image/gif;base64><p>Sure, <a href=# rel=noopener>Loki</a> takes place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe where superheroes and belligerent aliens are commonplace, but the central theme to both Loki and Dark is “time.” Loki spends most of his… time… working for (and sometimes against) the Time Variance Authority, an agency that claims to be responsible for maintaining the timeline of the one, true universe and prevents the world from fracturing into infinite multiverses. Just like in Dark, Loki asks the question: what happens when multiple timelines are occupied by the same people, and how do we know who belongs where?</p><p><a href=# class=article-list__stream-link rel=noopener>Where to Stream Loki<br></a></p><p><span class=item-number><span class=number-wrapper>3</span></span> <span class=item-heading-bg></span></p><h2 class=article-list__heading>‘11.22.63’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Hulu’s <a href=# rel=noopener>11.22.63</a>, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, asks the question, what would you do if you found a portal to the past and could change the course of history? When Jake Epping, a regular guy who lives in Maine (as all Stephen King heroes do), discovers a portal to the past, he decides to relocate there in order to stop the assassination of President Kennedy. Armed with the knowledge of what he knows in the present, he travels the country to prevent tragedies from occurring before finally arriving in Dallas in 1963, but what he doesn’t take into consideration is how his actions might also change the future.</p><p><a href=# class=article-list__stream-link rel=noopener>Where to Stream 11.22.63<br></a></p><p><span class=item-number><span class=number-wrapper>4</span></span> <span class=item-heading-bg></span></p><h2 class=article-list__heading>‘Curon’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In the moody, Italian series <a href=# rel=noopener>Curon</a>, a woman named Anna returns to her dark, mysterious hometown with her 17-year-old twins Daria and Mauro.

But that won’t be a problem because before long, Anna vanishes and her kids must find out what happened to her.

Created by Leslye Headland, Natasha Lyonne, and Amy Poehler, the story centers on Nadia (Lyonne), a woman who keeps dying on her 36th birthday, only to wake up and repeat the day over and over again. When she meets a man named Alan (Charlie Barnett) who is experiencing the same thing, they try to figure out why they are trapped in these time loops. As they investigate why they keep dying and being, well, reborn, they get to relive their experiences, run into alternate versions of themselves, and reconcile with their pasts as they try and get back to their regular lives.</p><p><a href=# class=article-list__stream-link rel=noopener>Where To Stream Russian Doll<br></a></p><p><span class=item-number><span class=number-wrapper>7</span></span> <span class=item-heading-bg></span></p><h2 class=article-list__heading>‘The OA’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Brit Marling created and starred in <a href=# rel=noopener>The OA</a>, which was sadly canceled after just two seasons.
