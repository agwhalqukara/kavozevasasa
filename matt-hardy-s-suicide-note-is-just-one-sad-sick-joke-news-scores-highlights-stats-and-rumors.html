He's an adult who is addicted to shock value, which ironically led to him allowing his own brother to taser his girlfriend. <a href=#>Matt Hardy</a> posted a YouTube video which was simply a suicide note that stated this:</p><p>"Goodbye, World...<br>My time here is Almost complete...<br>I only have a few hours & minutes...<br>I loved you all...<br>Regardless of how you felt about me...<br>I'll miss you all...<br>September 23, 1974 - August 31, 2011."</p><p>The video has been removed, as it's violates YouTube's term of service.</p><p>The past few weeks we've seen Matt in a car accident, which led to him being arrested for a DUI. That DUI led to Matt being fired from TNA and he took a fall inside his own home. With his disturbing behavior increasing and the recent events occurring in the past two weeks, it would surprise no one&nbsp; that Matt Hardy is suicidal.</p><p>Michael Zennie, a reporter for the Fayetteville Observer, tweeted this:</p><p>"The night shift captain said police received 25 to 30 phone calls to 911 to check on his well being."</p><p>Those 25 to 30 phone calls were from concern fans. It's disturbing to know that the note is not real in terms of Hardy being suicidal, but that he written and posted it as an attempt at shock value. Family and friends confirm that the note is fake.</p><p>Jeff Hardy's wife, Beth Britt, tweeted this in regards to her brother-in-law:</p><p>"When the cops show up to our house at 11 pm for a 'suicide call' the f---ing joke is over. Stop trying to work the internet."</p><p>Matt Hardy's friend Shane Helms tweeted this:</p><p>"Don't believe the hype" ... "And please don't bash me for it. I didn't do it, had nothing to do with it."</p><p>The respected Jim Ross tweeted this:</p><p>"Matt Hardy fiasco totally embarrassing & inexplicable. Alleged suicide you tube got him noticed...sadly in absurd way. Matt, seek answers."</p><p>This entire "stunt' or over-the-top antic has made me very angry and sad because suicide is nothing to joke about. In 2007, it was the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., accounting for 34,598 deaths (<a href=# title=source rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>).</p><p>I personally know people who've committed suicide and it pisses me off that someone would joke about it, especially since it causes people to lose friends and family.&nbsp;</p><p>This is also a proverbial slap in the face to suicide survivors. Obviously suicide is a serious condition. It is also one where the survivors undergo treatment, in case the urge appears again.</p><p>By Hardy using this serious condition as a publicity stunt, it in a way mocks those who've committed and survive suicide.</p><p>I'm sad for the fact that Matt Hardy is spiraling out of control. His behavior is to the point where he's in worse shape than his brother Jeff was in on his worse days. Hardy used to be respected as someone with a level head and the more sensible of the brothers. His fall from grace is tragic and the respect that he had is now gone, as his "stunts" have crossed too many lines for anyone to respect him.</p><p>&nbsp; Matt Hardy did release an apology to TMZ and his comments are this:&nbsp;</p><p>"was not in any way a suicide note. I want to reassure everyone that I am doing great right now."</p><p>he then adds, "I went from being the guy who wanted to change the world, entertain and inspire people, to being someone who was more concerned about shock value."</p><p>He also claims he going back to the "old Matt Hardy".</p><p>I'm going to take that with a grain of salt, as this is the same guy who claims his time is now, even though his time never came. He says many things, but a lot of them are broken promises and disappointments in my opinion. All I can hope for is that he gets his life together and returns to the sensible guy he once was!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJob2txYmqDbrnAratmoJGnsbq%2FjKysopuZmbJuus6tnGaho2K3tr%2FTZqannV2orqV50qKapGWapLim</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatt-hardy-s-suicide-note-is-just-one-sad-sick-joke-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmatt-hardy-s-suicide-note-is-just-one-sad-sick-joke-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmatt-hardy-s-suicide-note-is-just-one-sad-sick-joke-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmatt-hardy-s-suicide-note-is-just-one-sad-sick-joke-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatt-hardy-s-suicide-note-is-just-one-sad-sick-joke-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-hardy-s-suicide-note-is-just-one-sad-sick-joke-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./max-george-talks-new-single-better-on-me.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./max-george-talks-new-single-better-on-me.html>Max George talks new single 'Better On Me'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chelsea-ambriz-celebsgraphy.html>Chelsea Ambriz Celebsgraphy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chelsea-ambriz-celebsgraphy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
