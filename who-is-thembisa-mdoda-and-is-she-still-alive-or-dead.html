The actress celebrated her 40th birthday in a grand style in November 2022. A few days before her birthday, she <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">received</a> a Volkswagen Taigo car worth R449,000.</p><p>Having bagged a brand ambassadorial gig with Benoni Citi VW that month, Thembisa was gifted the luxury car as part of her endorsement deal. She found it hard to contain her joy and then took to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to announce that she had joined the Benoni Citi VW family and was grateful for the early birthday gift received from the brand.</p><h2><b>Her Parents’ Names are Pat and Yolisa Mdoda</b></h2><p>The name of Thembisa Mdoda’s mother is Yolisa while her father’s name is Pat. Sadly, in the year 2009, Thembisa Mdoda’s mother, Yolisa Mdoda passed away from pancreatic cancer and her death broke down the family.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Speaking to Drum</a> in 2020 about the loss of her mother to cancer, the House of Zwide actress stated that she wasn’t quite close to her mum while alive. Nonetheless, her death hit her so hard that she felt pains all over her body when her father broke the news of her passing to her.</p><p>Afterward, she <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">regretted</a> not spending enough time with her mum as she was busy growing her career in entertainment. Despite regretting not being close to her mother, the acclaimed TV presenter was grateful that her late mum shaped her values which greatly influenced her to become the woman she is today.</p><p>She said her mother taught her how to love and take care of the people close to her, putting them first. The late Yolisa Mdoda worked as a publicist at Transnet and an SABC1 continuity presenter. On the other hand, Thembisa’s father, Patillizwe ‘Pat’ Mdoda is still alive.

Zama Mdoda studied Politics, Philosophy, and Economics at a New York-based university. She currently lives in New York.</p><p>With their mother, a former media personality, it’s no surprise that Anele and Thembisa Mdoda-Nxumalo followed in her footsteps and have grown to be ranked among the most popular media figures in Mzansi. Thembisa Mdoda is almost two years older than her sister, Anele Mdoda who was born on May 19th, 1984.</p><p>Anele acquired a degree in Politics and International Relations at the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>University of Pretoria</a>.

She first obtained a degree in Drama and Journalism from <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Wits University</a>. With the determination to become an all-around entertainer, she proceeded with her post-graduate studies at the same university and earned Honours in Dramatic Arts in 2008.</p><p>Mdoda additionally bagged a degree in Graphic Design from the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>University of Cape Town</a>. Little wonder, she has emerged as one of the most sought-after presenters in South Africa.</p><h2><strong>She Began her Career as a Radio On-Air Personality</strong></h2><p>Thembisa Mdoda started her career in radio and has climbed to the top, thanks to her sheer dedication and talent. Also, her ability to speak many South African languages paved a way for her to achieve an upward career trajectory. The Eastern Cape native fluently speaks <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Xhosa</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Pedi</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Tswana</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Zulu</a>, and English.</p><p>Thembisa had her first radio gig while in the university as she worked as a newsreader for Voice of Wits.

Every season, a new presenter gets introduced to the show, and the Mthatha-born was deemed a perfect fit for the job that year. Serving as a replacement for <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Tumi Morake</a>, who’s one of the show’s best presenters, was a huge task for Thembisa Mdoda.</p><p>However, she moved on to nail her role in the show and her signature signing-off catchphrase, “Sifike! Sabona! Satshatisa!” made her a TV darling. Thembisa was mesmerizing to watch and interestingly, her role in Our Perfect Wedding won her some accolades as she emerged as one of SA’s best presenters.</p><p>While on the show, the media personality was dubbed a national treasure by viewers. She proved that she was not only working for fun but to make a positive impact in the lives of people when she went the extra mile to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">give</a> a bride a perfect wedding. After a series of disappointments that made Mr. and Mrs. Khanyile’s big day impossible to happen, Thembisa beckoned on her crew to assist her to get things moving.</p><p>Seeing the bride in tears got her shattered and she had to step up her role than just working as a presenter. And with that benevolence act, Mdoda completely captured the heart of Mzansi. Despite hitting a career-high with her work on OPW, Thembisa Mdoda decided it was time for her to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">move on</a> from the show and build her acting career in 2017.</p><p>She left Our Perfect Wedding, having had a tight schedule on the show which made it difficult for her to progress in her career. Though many said she was doomed to fail, Thembisa’s star has kept on shining brighter on global stages ever since.</p><h2><strong>Thembisa Mdoda Has Since Hosted Many of SA’s Popular Shows</strong></h2><p>Even though she left Our Perfect Wedding to focus on acting, Thembisa Mdoda couldn’t resist the urge to return to the small screen as a show host.

In June 2019, the award-winning presenter was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">announced</a> as the host of the wedding show, 2 Families and a Wedding Dress.</p><p>The reality wedding show saw BET Africa partnering up with Veil Bridal Couture – an exclusive Pronovias retailer to give 13 lucky brides the chance to pick the wedding dress of their dreams. Later on, Thembisa Mdoda-Nxumalo <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">had</a> one of her career highlights when she was made the<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> co-host</a> of a pan-African singing competition, Old Mutual Amazing Voices.</p><p>She joined the show in the second season and became quite famous across the continent as Old Mutual Amazing Voices aired on eight African channels across the African continent. Still pushing her way to the top, the 41 years old <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">landed</a> another big hosting gig in June 2022.</p><p>On Mzansi Wethu, she debuted as the host of Suxoka, which means ‘don’t lie’ in isiXhosa, the next month.

She is alive and well. However, she had a serious health scare in 2021 when she tested positive for COVID-19 and was hospitalized due to having an allergic reaction that aggravated her health condition. Soon after the former Isibaya actress <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">shared</a> on Instagram that she was fighting for her life at the hospital, speculations about her passing started circulating online.</p><p>Though she spent some months at Sandton Mediclinic, she made full recovery after the doctors <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">gave</a> her six months break. She was discharged from the hospital in late August 2021 and was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">grateful</a> for the outpouring of love and prayers she received.
