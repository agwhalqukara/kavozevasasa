Fans are often surprised to discover gospel roots in her first music.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Katy Perry’s first song under her stage name was titled Ur So Gay, released in May of 2007. It was the lead single from her first EP also titled Ur So Gay. Prior to this, she had released her debut eponymous album under her birth name, Katy Hudson. The album was of Christian rock but did not chart well, so she reinvented herself as Katy Perry.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Once the singer changed her name to Katy Perry, and her music style to mainstream pop, she was met with widespread commercial success. Learn more about her journey below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Debuting With Christian Rock</h2><p>Katy Perry was born with the name Katheryn Hudson in Santa Barbara, California in 1984.&nbsp;</p><p>Both of her parents, Maurice Keith Hudson and Mary Christine, are Pentecostal pastors and <a href=# rel=noopener>born again</a> Christians, turning to their faith after a<a href=# rel=noopener> “wild youth”.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>She would <a href=# rel=noopener>attend</a> various different churches and Christian schools as she moved between states in her youth.</p><p>Perry’s Christian faith greatly influenced her early music. From the ages of 9-17, she sang in Church.</p><p>When her parents gifted her a guitar at the age of 13, she would perform on the street.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> GQ magazine, “I’d go to the farmers’ market in Santa Barbara, and I’d put out my guitar case, and I’d test out these little ditty songs that I would write, and I would get a couple of avocados, a bag of pistachios, and, like, fifteen bucks.”</p><p>Her first album was of the gospel genre since she had <a href=# rel=noopener>trouble</a> accessing popular music, which was discouraged in her Evangelical household.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> Vanity Fair that she “wasn’t even allowed to listen to secular music and relied on friends to sneak her CDs.”</p><p>The album was an eponymous release by <a href=# rel=noopener>Red Hill Records</a> in 2001, when she was just 16, titled <a href=# rel=noopener>Katy Hudson</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Katy Hudson incorporates contemporary Christian music with Christian Rock and Pop Rock, including a variety of religious themes such as the singer’s faith in God and adolescence.</p><p>It includes tracks such as <a href=# rel=noopener>Faith Won’t Fail</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Piercing</a>, describing the singer’s devotion to God.</p><p>Unfortunately, Red Hill Records went bankrupt before Katy was able to release her album.&nbsp;</p><p>This meant they could not afford to advertise, and the album only sold around 200 copies.</p><p>Perry went on tour to promote the album, but the most popular single on the track titled <a href=# rel=noopener>Trust In Me</a> peaked at number 17 of the Christian Rock Radio & Records charts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Changing Her Image</h2><p>After her eponymous studio album did not fare well, the singer decided to take a different approach.</p><p>She moved to L.A, reinventing herself with the stage name Katy Perry in an attempt to venture into secular music.</p><p>In April 2007, she was signed with <a href=# rel=noopener>Capitol Records</a>, shortly after which she released an EP titled <a href=# rel=noopener>Ur So Gay</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It featured four tracks, and although it did not chart well, the titles <a href=# rel=noopener>Ur So Gay</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Lost</a> would later feature in her 2008 album <a href=# rel=noopener>One of the Boys</a>.</p><p>Ur So Gay was intended to introduce Perry as an artist, sparking interest in her target market before she released her album.&nbsp;</p><p>However, many critics <a href=# rel=noopener>argued</a> that her lyrics were “gay-baiting” and “slyly homophobic.”</p><p>Perry’s first single from her second album was titled <a href=# rel=noopener>I Kissed A Girl</a>. The song fared extremely well, peaking at number 1 on the US Billboard Top 100.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The song is wildly famous, but received <a href=# rel=noopener>mixed</a> reviews from both the LGBT community for “using bi-curiosity to sell records” and the religious community for its homosexual themes.</p><p>It topped charts in over 18 other countries, including the UK and Canada.</p><p>After this, Perry skyrocketed to international success with several more number 1 singles such as <a href=# rel=noopener>Hot n Cold</a>, and chart-topping albums including <a href=# rel=noopener>Teenage Dream</a> which had 5 number 1 singles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdrK60ecqaq7JloJq%2Fs8XSZp2iqqOperS7zaBm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-was-katy-perry-s-first-song.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-was-katy-perry-s-first-song.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-was-katy-perry-s-first-song.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-was-katy-perry-s-first-song.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-was-katy-perry-s-first-song.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-katy-perry-s-first-song.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aaron-civale-injury-update-what-happened-to-him-find-out-his-girlfriend-details.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aaron-civale-injury-update-what-happened-to-him-find-out-his-girlfriend-details.html>Aaron Civale Injury Update: What Happened To Him?
