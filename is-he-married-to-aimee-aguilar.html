As a celebrity, it's not surprising for celebrities to be linked with other stars and Khalifa is no exception. The American rapper has been linked with several women but the rapper has only dated <strong>Natalie Nunn</strong>, <strong>Indyamarie Jean</strong>, <strong>Izabela Guedes</strong>, <strong>Winnie Harlow</strong>, and <strong>Amber Rose</strong> officially.</p><p>Natalie Nunn is a well-known television personality best recognized for her role in the Bad Girls Club's fourth season, and the two of them, Khalifa and Nunn, only dated for a short time from October to December 2010. Similarly, Wiz Khalifa also dated a fashion model, Indyamarie Jean&nbsp;from October to December 2015.</p><p>Similar to Jean and Nunn, the Canadian fashion model and public spokesperson on the skin condition vitiligo, Winnie Harlow also dated Khalifa for a few months in the fall of 2018. The couple made their relationship official on Valentine's Day 2017 but things didn't work out for them and they broke up in February 2018.</p><p>Following the breakup of his relationship with Nunn, Khalifa started dating rapper, model, and television personality, Amber Rose. Aguilar is largely known for modeling on Instagram, but she has also dabbled in acting, making brief appearances in Impractical Jokers and Power episodes, in addition to launching her own reasonably priced swimsuit line, Oasis Swim, this past summer.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><p>They dated for a year before being engaged and getting married on July 8, 2013. Of all the relationships, breaking up with Amber was a tough call for Khalifa and he has even opened up about the split and <a href=# rel=noopener>stated</a>,</p><p><strong>I was sad after it ended, but I wasn’t depressed. I’ve never really been depressed in my life. I was sad because we were going through a lot and my son was involved, and that hurt me because my main goal is to raise my son how I want. I’m a control freak, and not being able to control that was weird. I didn’t know how to deal with it and didn’t understand that feeling. A year later, I’m way smarter and better equipped to deal with it. I feel like not being in that relationship helped me out a lot.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/wiz-khalifa-amber-rose.jpg alt="Wiz Khalifa dated Amber Rose and shares a son with her." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Wiz Khalifa dated Amber Rose and shares a son with her.</strong><br><strong>Source: Celebs Fortune</strong></p><p>Khalifa and Rose were a relationship goal for years before getting divorced three years later.
