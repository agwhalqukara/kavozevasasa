They had the celebrity child just a year into their relationship and went their separate ways when she was around a year old.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Jenn Harley’s relationship was nothing short of tumultuous since they began dating in July 2017. The couple met through mutual friends and quickly embarked on a roller-coaster journey filled with ups and downs. They dated for only a couple of years, but their relationship was marred by frequent breakups, public feuds on social media, and physical altercations.</span></p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/Ronnie-ortiz-magro-jen-harley-1.jpg alt="Ariana Sky Magro" width=696 height=1124 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their tumultuous relationship resulted in several legal issues. They were involved in a battery domestic violence incident during a New Year’s Eve party, which led to Ortiz-Magro filing a report against Harley, and she was arrested. Additionally, they faced cheating allegations and accusations of keeping sex videos and drug use.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite their tumultuous relationship, Ortiz-Magro and Harley welcomed their daughter, Ariana Sky, in April 2018. Notwithstanding their subsequent breakup in 2019, they continue to co-parent Ariana, putting her well-being first. The chaos and drama surrounding their relationship undoubtedly had an impact on Ariana, as she was exposed to public fights and legal issues involving her parents.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who Has Ariana Sky Magro’s Custody?</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to court filings obtained by the U.S. Sun, Ariana’s dad has primary physical custody of her. This means that she lives with him during the school year. However, it is important to note that both her parents are equally involved in her upbringing.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In the past, there have been instances where Ariana was briefly in the custody of her father’s family. This occurred when her mother, Jenn Harley, was arrested for physically abusing her father. It is unclear how they (Ariana’s parents) specifically reacted to this situation. Still, it is safe to assume that they were concerned for their child’s well-being and worked together to ensure her safety and best interests.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It is worth mentioning that Ariana’s parents have had their fair share of challenges and struggles in the past. Her father, Ronnie, has openly addressed his struggles with mental health and substance abuse issues. He has taken breaks from the spotlight to focus on his well-being and is now dedicated to being a present and balanced father for Ariana.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While the Jersey Shore star has primary physical custody of Ariana, it is evident that both parents are committed to co-parenting and maintaining a healthy relationship for the sake of their daughter. Ariana needs to have the love and support of both parents, and by working together, they can provide her with a stable and nurturing environment.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ariana Sky Magro Has Two Half Siblings</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ariana Sky Magro has two half-siblings, both from her maternal side. Her oldest half-sibling, a half-brother named Mason Roger, was born during her mother’s first marriage to ex-husband Joshua Roger.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Not much is known about Mason, including the date of his birth and how old he is. However, social media pictures of the siblings together indicate that Ariana is significantly younger than her older half-brother.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Adriana is more than half a decade older than her younger half-brother, Jayden Ambrosole, who was born on October 18, 2023. He is a product of the celebrity child’s mom’s relationship with partner Joe Ambrosole.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmmKuhkaOubr%2FKsmSmmZenvG6%2Bzqelop1dpL%2B1tdlmpJqfoqTAbrDArp6hrJWneri106Fko52eo3qprdGlnLJn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-ariana-sky-magro-ronnie-ortiz-magro-s-daughter-with-jenn-harley.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-ariana-sky-magro-ronnie-ortiz-magro-s-daughter-with-jenn-harley.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-ariana-sky-magro-ronnie-ortiz-magro-s-daughter-with-jenn-harley.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-ariana-sky-magro-ronnie-ortiz-magro-s-daughter-with-jenn-harley.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-ariana-sky-magro-ronnie-ortiz-magro-s-daughter-with-jenn-harley.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-ariana-sky-magro-ronnie-ortiz-magro-s-daughter-with-jenn-harley.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./roughly-one-third-of-the-earth-s-surface-nyt-crossword-clue.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./roughly-one-third-of-the-earth-s-surface-nyt-crossword-clue.html>Roughly one-third of the earth's surface NYT Crossword Clue</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./former-liverpool-defender-rigobert-song-in-critical-condition-after-stroke-news-scores-highlight.html>Former Liverpool Defender Rigobert Song in Critical Condition After Stroke | News, Scores, Highlight</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./former-liverpool-defender-rigobert-song-in-critical-condition-after-stroke-news-scores-highlight.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
