It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when things changed for him, but his stay in Pentonville certainly didn’t help matters.</p><p>He had to keep his head down and learn to fend for himself. Being the nice guy wasn’t going to protect him in prison, and he learned that quickly — nearly losing his life when his guard was down.</p><p>Maybe that incident gave him plenty of time to think about his demeanor, and why he might look like an easy target to so many people.</p><p>While he wouldn’t have stood a chance against two other prisoners teaming up against him even if he saw them coming, he is starting to think differently about how he navigates the world — and that starts at home with ELQ, Aurora, and the Quartermaines.</p><p>But is that all there is to it — a simple shift in perspective, or is something more sinister amiss?</p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers — Drew Isn’t Drew</h3><p>We get the point. He’s not himself. But what if he is actually not himself? What if the guy who came home from prison is not Drew? Or perhaps the guy who came back from Australia is not Drew?</p><p>We’ve seen stranger than body doubles, evil twins, and total takeovers of someone’s personality in Port Charles. Could it be someone else who looks like Drew but isn’t?</p><p>If so, we’re certain to see signs of that soon as he struggles to keep his story straight and lets clues slip that make it sound like he doesn’t have knowledge of Drew’s past.</p><p>Of course, if Drew has been brainwashed much the way he was before, those memories will be intact, but he’ll continue to act of out character for himself.</p><p><img alt="General Hospital: Drew Cain (Cameron Mathison)" width=730 height=501 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/01/general-hospital-spoilers-the-top-fan-theories-as-to-why-drew-is-acting-so-strange/ data-jpibfi-post-title="General Hospital Spoilers: The Top Fan Theories As To Why Drew Is Acting So Strange" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GH-Drew-Cain.jpg></p><h3>GH Spoilers Suggest Drew Has Crossed Over To The Dark Side</h3><p><a href=#>Keeping himself safe in prison might have meant joining ranks with the wrong people</a> — people like Cyrus Renault (Jeff Kober). Is it possible that Drew was tempted to make friends in low places to keep his head above water?</p><p>Perhaps. He may also have found himself in their company after they threatened the people that he loves. If he feels compelled to have to protect Carly Spencer (Laura Wright), Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco), Scout Cain (Cosette Abinante), or the Quartermaines, there’s no telling how low he’d stoop to make it happen.</p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers — Drew Is Jason</h3><p><a href=#>Ever since that underground cave came tumbling down</a> on top of Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), we’ve all wondered how he would eventually return to Port Charles — and continued to hold out hope that he would.</p><p>While his death was confirmed, the body was never found. In Port Charles, that likely means he’s off somewhere being held against his will. Could Peter August (Wes Ramsey) or Victor Cassadine (Charles Shaughnessy) have had a hand in keeping him away and messing with his brain waves all over again?</p><p>If so, is it possible he’s been transformed to look like his twin brother who, ironically, no longer looked like him? That would be a clever way to circumvent bringing Steve Burton back to the show, and it’s almost certain fans would be ticked.</p><p>The chemistry between Carly and Jason won’t happen with Laura and Cameron — or will it? Is the lack of sizzle all because Drew is just too darned kind? Stay<a href=# rel=noopener> tuned for more GH news and spoilers to find out.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX91e49qZqCdnpq%2ForiMoaasqJmprq150qmmoqSVp8BuwMeeZK2noGKzorqMrZ%2Bep6KesrR5wKxkraddrLW6ecOrnLBlmah6oq%2FToqWgZaOkerTA0ZqloJ1f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-top-fan-theories-as-to-why-drew-is-acting-so-strange.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-top-fan-theories-as-to-why-drew-is-acting-so-strange.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-top-fan-theories-as-to-why-drew-is-acting-so-strange.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-top-fan-theories-as-to-why-drew-is-acting-so-strange.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-top-fan-theories-as-to-why-drew-is-acting-so-strange.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-top-fan-theories-as-to-why-drew-is-acting-so-strange.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-did-johnny-depp-and-amber-heard-meet-the-trial-reveals-first-movie-set-interactions.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-did-johnny-depp-and-amber-heard-meet-the-trial-reveals-first-movie-set-interactions.html>How Did Johnny Depp and Amber Heard Meet?
