He was the founder of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in 1986.

Though filmmaker <strong>Rachel Dretzin’s </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@rdmerlin</a>)&nbsp;four-part series is at times difficult to watch, the first-hand tales from survivors are nothing short of incredible.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=4><strong>Roy Jeffs</strong>, a former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, was born on June 5, 1992, and died on May 29, 2019. His father <strong>Warren Jeffs</strong>, the self-proclaimed prophet, had 54 <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>children</a></strong>, and he was one of them.</p><p class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=5>After leaving the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>FLDS</a></strong>, Roy became one of the first of his father’s children to accuse him of sexual abuse. Warren Jeffs, Roy’s father, sexually and psychologically assaulted him as a child. He was determined to convey his experience to help other family members break out of the organization led by their father, who is serving a life sentence in Texas for sexually assaulting young women he deemed brides.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>In 2015, Roy Jeffs told the Associated Press that his father had an iron fist over the group headquartered along the Utah-Arizona state boundary, segregating families and prohibiting items like movies and bicycles. Roy was one of the first to accuse the polygamous sect prophet of sexually abusing children.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Roy Jeffs died when he was 26 years old, just eight days before his 27th birthday, on Tuesday, May 29, 2019. The cause of his death was suicide. Jeffs committed suicide at his Salt Lake City residence. Funeral services were held at Larkin Sunset Gardens Mortuary in Sandy, Utah, on June 8, 2019. His family set up a <a href=# rel=noopener>GoFundMe</a> account to help with burial expenses.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=3 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>During his childhood, despite being denied access to television and toys, Jeffs reported a joyful childhood spent with his mother landscaping and gardening. However, he felt neglected and ostracized by his father, and he witnessed his mother’s psychological torture (who was not one of his favored wives).</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>His father began to isolate him from the rest of the family and town when he was around ten years old. When Jeff was 12 years old, he and his mother had transported away for the first time. At the age of 14, three days after his father’s <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>imprisonment</a></strong> in 2006, he was taken to a Wyoming ranch without his mother. He was transferred from a hiding place to the compounds, which served as a haven for him.</p><p data-paragraphid=4 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>In 2015, Roy Jeffs exposed and told The Associated Press that his father ruled over the group situated along the Utah-Arizona border with an iron grip, separating families and prohibiting items like movies and bicycles. Roy Jeffs’s mother remained in the group, and his sister <strong>Richard</strong> said the entire separation from her was very hard for him.</p><p class=root-block-node data-paragraphid=3 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>He was allowed to rejoin his family at the YFZ Ranch, but he only stayed for three weeks due to his father’s admission that he was attracted to some of his father’s wives (who were close to his age). He believed the confession was required since God had disclosed all of his life’s details.</p><p data-paragraphid=3 data-from-init=true data-changed=false>Before you leave, check out <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Warren’s net worth</a></strong>.</p><p data-paragraphid=3 data-from-init=true data-changed=false><strong>Visit <a href=#>Blurred Reality</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianKq%2Fs7HDZqmemZyewbp6wqikaKqfrnqrscWfqmabkarApnnOn2SdnZGptXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeffs-committed-suicide-at-his-salt-lake-city-residence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeffs-committed-suicide-at-his-salt-lake-city-residence.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeffs-committed-suicide-at-his-salt-lake-city-residence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeffs-committed-suicide-at-his-salt-lake-city-residence.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeffs-committed-suicide-at-his-salt-lake-city-residence.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeffs-committed-suicide-at-his-salt-lake-city-residence.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jerry-rice-wife-who-is-he-married-to-iconic-nfl-player-relationship-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jerry-rice-wife-who-is-he-married-to-iconic-nfl-player-relationship-family.html>Jerry Rice Wife: Who Is He Married To?
