The pair met for the first time in 2001 when they both attended a party in Sydney. They hit it off immediately, with Sacha claiming they bonded over “taking the mick out of the other people in the party.” Isla and Sacha dated for three years before they got engaged in 2004.</p><p>However, the couple took time with their wedding preparation, mainly because Isla decided to convert to Judaism, following the religion of Sacha.</p><p>“I will definitely have a Jewish wedding just to be with Sacha,” Isla shared with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hello Magazine</a>. “I would do anything, move into any religion, to be united in marriage with him,” the actress continued.</p><p>Shortly after her conversion to Judaism in 2007, Isla and Sacha welcomed their first child, a daughter named Olive. The pair married in a “secret wedding in Paris” in 2010, several months before they welcomed their second daughter, Elula.</p><p class=related-post>Also Read: <a href=#>Who is Rachel McAdams Husband in 2023?

It seemed like Darren was utterly obsessed, as he once claimed that Isla was the first girl he had “been in love with.”</p><p>But then again, it’s not that hard to love Isla Fisher!</p><p>Unfortunately, the former couple decided to end things after their hectic schedules prevented them from spending time together.</p><p class=related-post>See Also: <a href=#>Perry Mattfeld Is Married! Here’s How She Met Her Husband</a></p><p>In 2016, Darren shared in an episode of Celebrity Big Brother that he accidentally met <strong>Isla and her husband, Sacha Baron Cohen</strong>, the night before! As if meeting your ex and their new partner isn’t awkward enough, Darren felt even more awkward since he was starstruck seeing Sacha in person!</p><p>“There was the awkwardness of bumping into an ex you’ve not seen for a few years and meeting the new partner,” Darren shared in the episode. “But I also wanted to say, ‘Listen mate, I think you’re bloody amazing,’” he added.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Did Isla Fisher and Shane Ammann Date?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Shane-Ammann-photoshoot-916x1024.jpg><p>Home and Away is famous for many things, including its share of inappropriate on-screen relationships! One was Shannon and Curtis Reed, portrayed by <strong>Isla Fisher and Shane Ammann</strong>.</p><p>Shannon and Curtis were siblings, not by blood, but by adoption. They developed feelings for each other (it’s still weird, I know) and were caught kissing on the couch. They didn’t end up together in the soap opera, but many fans suspect that Isla and Shane had something going on behind the camera!</p><p>Rumor has it that Isla and Shane dated briefly in 1994, shortly after they were cast to join the cast ensemble of Home and Away. However, neither Isla nor Shane ever addressed the rumors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibopqytbuNnKamZ5mouaJ5xaKqoZ2iYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnWoquhZZiav2601KyZmqaUZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-isla-fisher-s-decades-long-relationship-with-her-husband-and-her-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-isla-fisher-s-decades-long-relationship-with-her-husband-and-her-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-isla-fisher-s-decades-long-relationship-with-her-husband-and-her-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-isla-fisher-s-decades-long-relationship-with-her-husband-and-her-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-isla-fisher-s-decades-long-relationship-with-her-husband-and-her-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-isla-fisher-s-decades-long-relationship-with-her-husband-and-her-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lane-kiffin-details-dramatic-tennessee-exit-after-accepting-usc-coaching-job-news-scores-highlig.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lane-kiffin-details-dramatic-tennessee-exit-after-accepting-usc-coaching-job-news-scores-highlig.html>Lane Kiffin Details Dramatic Tennessee Exit After Accepting USC Coaching Job | News, Scores, Highlig</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./david-ellenson-dies-at-age-76-a-man-of-reform-judaism.html>David Ellenson dies at age 76: a man of Reform Judaism</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./david-ellenson-dies-at-age-76-a-man-of-reform-judaism.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
