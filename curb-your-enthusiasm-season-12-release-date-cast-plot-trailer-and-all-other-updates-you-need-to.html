Moreover, Larry was accused of sexual harassment, and he tried to handle the situation, but with his attitude, things only got worse.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We might see the continuation of these aspects. Also, you must have noticed that season two spotlighted current issues in</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=true>society like the MeToo movement and MAGA. Maybe season two will also include satirical comments on various topics. One more thing we are sure of is that he will get kicked out of some parties in season 11; he has mastered that art</span>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will there be Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 12?</h2><p>Larry David announced that HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” <a href=#>will return for a twelfth season</a> during an Emmys event at the DGA.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rejoice!
