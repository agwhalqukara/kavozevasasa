American rocker who first was recognized by finishing second on Season 5 on American Idol.&nbsp;The song he sang “Inside Your Heaven” charted at number 2 at the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>He was defeated by&nbsp;Carrie Underwood&nbsp;on the fourth season of American Idol.</p><p>Bice was born in Hunstville, Alabama to Nancy and Herold Elwin Bice. His mother was a gospel singer as were his grandmother, great-grandmother, and aunts. Bice was nicknamed “Bogart” as a newborn by his grandmother, “Granny Madge”, because she thought he had “Humphrey Bogart eyes”. His family continued to call him Bogart, but when Bice was in kindergarten he shortened it to “Bo” because he did not think Bogart was cool. Bice’s parents divorced when he was very young, and his mother remarried years later. Bice grew up with his mother and step-father, Earle Downes, a Coca-Cola manager, step-sisters Jenny and Sharan Downes, and half-brother John Cohran. Bice has two other half-siblings, Candace and Matthew, on his biological father’s side. The Downes family moved around the South frequently. They lived in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, including the metro area of Atlanta. In 1990 when Bice was 14 years old they moved to England, as part of his step-father’s European assignment with Coca-Cola in London.</p><p>Bice spent his teenage years living in Gerrards Cross. Bice attended London Central High School, a Department of Defense school primarily for children whose parents served in the military or worked at the U.S. Embassy. In high school, he carried his guitar everywhere and played football. It was around this time when Bice worked with some English alternative rock musicians. He formed his first band, Spinning Jenny, while living there. Bice would have graduated in 1994, but in the fall of 1993, Bice dropped out of high school just before turning 18 to move back to Alabama, where he earned his GED and attended classes at Calhoun Community College from November 1996 to May 1997.</p><p align=justify>Three sons are his as well as one daughter, who live with him and his partner, Caroline and Merrin Fisher.
