In between his years in Minnesota, Tarkenton was a member of the <a class=tronLink href=#>New York Giants</a> for five seasons. At the time of his retirement, Tarkenton owned every major quarterback record. He was inducted into the <a class=tronLink href=#>Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1986 and the <a class=tronLink href=#>College Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1987.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/fran-tarkenton-7127322d-1519-42b8-8283-d73ff3159e1-resize-750.aspx><p>In addition to his football career, Tarkenton served as a commentator on <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Monday Night Football</a></i> and a co-host of <i>That's Incredible!</i>. He also founded Tarkenton Software, a computer-program generator company, and he toured the U.S. promoting CASE (<a class=tronLink href=#>computer-aided software engineering</a>) with Albert F. Case Jr. of Nastec Corporation. Tarkenton Software later merged with <a class=tronLink href=#>KnowledgeWare</a> (with Tarkenton as president), until selling the company to <a class=tronLink href=#>Sterling Software</a> in 1994.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/fran-tarkenton-540d6ec1-de7d-4a92-9af4-16b75a39f82-resize-750.jpeg><span itemprop=thumbnail itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject></span><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Fran-Tarkenton-Highlights---Greatest-Scrambler-Ever>Fran Tarkenton Highlights - Greatest Scrambler Ever</h2><br><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Early-life>Early life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/fran-tarkenton-2769bdf6-2629-455c-8ada-da71ba927ae-resize-750.jpeg><p>Fran Tarkenton was born on February 3, 1940, in <a class=tronLink href=#>Richmond, Virginia</a>. His father, Dallas Tarkenton, Sr., was a Methodist minister. Fran Tarkenton went to Athens High School in <a class=tronLink href=#>Athens, Georgia</a>, and later attended the <a class=tronLink href=#>University of Georgia</a>, where he was the quarterback on the <a class=tronLink href=#>Bulldog football team</a> and a member of the <a class=tronLink href=#>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a> fraternity. Under Coach <a class=tronLink href=#>Wally Butts</a> and with Tarkenton as quarterback, Georgia won the 1959 Southeastern Conference championship. Tarkenton was a first-team All-SEC selection in both 1959 and 1960.</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Professional-football-career>Professional football career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/fran-tarkenton-ecc1817a-1181-4d04-803f-5b766f9ec49-resize-750.jpeg><p>The Minnesota Vikings drafted Tarkenton in the third round of the <a class=tronLink href=#>1961 NFL Draft</a>, and he was picked in the fifth round of the 1961 AFL draft by the <a class=tronLink href=#>Boston Patriots</a>. He signed with the Vikings. Tarkenton, 21, played his first National Football League game (and the Vikings' first game) on September 17 against the <a class=tronLink href=#>Chicago Bears</a> coming off the bench to lead the Vikings to a come-from-behind victory by passing for 250 yards and four touchdown passes and running for another as the Vikings defeated the Bears 37â€“13. He was the only player in NFL history to pass for four touchdowns in his first NFL game, until the feat was repeated by <a class=tronLink href=#>Marcus Mariota</a> in the <a class=tronLink href=#>Tennessee Titans</a>' 2015 season opener versus the <a class=tronLink href=#>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/fran-tarkenton-3eab3304-f190-4d53-8acb-39dd8d748c5-resize-750.jpeg><p>He played for the Vikings from 1961 to 1966.</p><p>Tarkenton was traded to the <a class=tronLink href=#>New York</a> Giants in 1967, at which time he moved to the New York City suburb of <a class=tronLink href=#>New Rochelle, New York</a>. In the first game of the 1969 season, Tarkenton's Giants played the Vikings. After trailing 23â€“10 in the fourth quarter, Tarkenton threw two touchdown passes to secure a 24â€“23 comeback victory over his former team. The 24 points allowed by Minnesota's defense were a season-worst for the unit, one more point than the Vikings allowed in losing <a class=tronLink href=#>Super Bowl IV</a> to the <a class=tronLink href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a>.</p><p>Tarkenton enjoyed his best season with the Giants in 1970. The club overcame an 0-3 start to win nine of 10 and move into position to win the <a class=tronLink href=#>NFC East</a> division championship in week 14. However, New York was routed 31-3 by the <a class=tronLink href=#>Los Angeles Rams</a> at <a class=tronLink href=#>Yankee Stadium</a>, leaving the Giants 9-5, one game behind the division champion <a class=tronLink href=#>Dallas Cowboys</a> and the wild card <a class=tronLink href=#>Detroit Lions</a>. 1970 was the closest the Giants came to making the playoffs during a 17-year drought, spanning the 1964 through 1980 seasons.</p><p>Tarkenton was traded back to Minnesota in 1972, for three players (<a class=tronLink href=#>Norm Snead</a>, <a class=tronLink href=#>Bob Grim</a> and Vince Clements), plus a first and second round draft choice. He led the Vikings to three Super Bowls in the 1970s, but lost all of them. In Tarkenton's first <a class=tronLink href=#>Super Bowl</a> appearance his team lost to the <a class=tronLink href=#>Miami Dolphins</a> 24â€“7 in <a class=tronLink href=#>Houston</a>. It lost the second to the <a class=tronLink href=#>Pittsburgh Steelers</a> 16â€“6 in <a class=tronLink href=#>New Orleans</a>, and in the last Super Bowl Tarkenton played (and Minnesota's last Super Bowl to date), the Vikings lost to the <a class=tronLink href=#>Oakland Raiders</a> 32â€“14 at the <a class=tronLink href=#>Rose Bowl</a> in <a class=tronLink href=#>Pasadena, California</a>.</p><p>In his 18 NFL seasons, Tarkenton completed 3,686 of 6,467 passes for 47,003 yards and 342 touchdowns, with 266 interceptions, all of which were NFL records at the time of his retirement. Tarkenton's 47,003 career passing yards rank him 8th all time, while his 342 career passing touchdowns is 6th all time in NFL history. He also is 6th on the all-time list of wins by a starting quarterback with 124 regular season victories. He also used his impressive scrambling ability to rack up 3,674 rushing yards and 32 touchdowns on 675 carries. During his career, Tarkenton ran for a touchdown in 15 different seasons, an NFL record among quarterbacks. He ranks fourth in career rushing yards among quarterbacks, behind <a class=tronLink href=#>Randall Cunningham</a>, Steve Young and <a class=tronLink href=#>Michael Vick</a>. He is also one of two NFL quarterbacks ever to rush for at least 300 yards in seven different seasons; the other is <a class=tronLink href=#>Tobin Rote</a>. When he retired, Tarkenton held NFL career records in pass attempts, completions, yardage, and touchdowns; rushing yards by a quarterback; and wins by a starting quarterback.</p><p>The Vikings finished the 1975 season with an NFC-best 12â€“2 record and Tarkenton won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award and the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award while capturing <a class=tronLink href=#>All-Pro</a> honors in the process. He was also a second-team <a class=tronLink href=#>All-Pro</a> in 1973 and earned All-NFC selections in 1972 and 1976. He was named second-team All-NFC in 1970 and 1974. Tarkenton was selected to play in nine <a class=tronLink href=#>Pro Bowls</a>.</p><p>Tarkenton was indecisive on his retirement during the last seven years of his playing career.</p><p>Despite not winning a Super Bowl, he won six playoff games, and in 1999 he was ranked #59 on <i>The Sporting News</i> list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.</p><p>Tarkenton was inducted into the <a class=tronLink href=#>Georgia Sports Hall of Fame</a> in 1977, the <a class=tronLink href=#>Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1986, the <a class=tronLink href=#>College Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1987, and the <a class=tronLink href=#>Athens, Georgia</a> Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Books>Books</h2><p>A biography of Tarkenton titled <i>Better Scramble than Lose</i> was published in 1969. This followed Tarkenton's 1967 autobiography <i>No Time for Losing</i> and preceded by several years his 1977 autobiography <i>Tarkenton</i> co-written with <a class=tronLink href=#>Jim Klobuchar</a>. The autobiographies chronicle not only his football career but also his personal evolution from his early football days as a preacher's son. Tarkenton co-wrote with <a class=tronLink href=#>Brock Yates</a> a book in 1971 titled <i>Broken Patterns: The Education of a Quarterback</i>, a chronicle of the 1970 New York Giants season.</p><p>In 1986, Tarkenton, with author Herb Resincow, wrote a novel titled <i>Murder at the Super Bowl</i>, the <a class=tronLink href=#>whodunit</a> story of a football coach killed just before his team is to participate in the championship game.</p><p>Tarkenton wrote the self-help, motivational books <i>Playing to Win</i> in 1984, and <i>How to Motivate People: The Team Strategy for Success</i> in 1986. He also wrote the motivational self-help business book titled <i>What Losing Taught Me About Winning</i>, and <i>Every Day is Game Day</i>. In 1987, Tarkenton hosted a <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Think and Grow Rich</a></i> TV infomercial that sold the book with an audio cassette version (the audio cassettes contained an introduction and conclusion by Tarkenton).</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Business-ventures-and-investments>Business ventures and investments</h2><p><a class=tronLink href=#>Mark McCormack</a> helped Tarkenton invest, making him wealthy enough to "retire this week if [he] wanted to", as <i>New York</i> magazine wrote in 1971. Tarkenton was a pioneer in computer software, and founder of Tarkenton Software, a program generator company. He toured the United States promoting CASE or "<a class=tronLink href=#>computer-aided software engineering</a>" with Albert F. Case, Jr. of Nastec Corporation, but ultimately merged his software firm with <a class=tronLink href=#>James Martin</a>'s <a class=tronLink href=#>KnowledgeWare</a>, of which Tarkenton was president until selling the company to <a class=tronLink href=#>Sterling Software</a> in 1994.</p><p>In 1999, Tarkenton was fined by federal regulators as part of a securities fraud sweep. According to the <i>LA Times</i>, "In Tarkenton's case, the Hall of Fame quarterback and 10 other former executives of his computer software and consulting firm, KnowledgeWare Inc., were accused of inflating by millions of dollars the company's earnings in reports for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1994. The former Minnesota Vikings quarterback agreed to pay a $100,000 fine and $54,187 in restitution. He did not admit any wrongdoing".</p><p>Since then, Tarkenton has been promoting various products and services including <a class=tronLink href=#>Tony Robbins</a> and 1-800-BAR-NONE. He also founded GoSmallBiz, a small-business consulting website. He also operates an <a class=tronLink href=#>annuity</a> marketing firm called Tarkenton Financial.</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Politics>Politics</h2><p>During the <a class=tronLink href=#>2016 Republican National Convention</a>, Tarkenton gave a speech endorsing Republican presidential nominee <a class=tronLink href=#>Donald Trump</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnJi1psDRqKVnm5%2BifIe%2BwKdkjZmioLKvwM6n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffran-tarkenton-alchetron-the-free-social-encyclopedia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffran-tarkenton-alchetron-the-free-social-encyclopedia.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffran-tarkenton-alchetron-the-free-social-encyclopedia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffran-tarkenton-alchetron-the-free-social-encyclopedia.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffran-tarkenton-alchetron-the-free-social-encyclopedia.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffran-tarkenton-alchetron-the-free-social-encyclopedia.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kane-brown-height-how-tall-is-kane.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kane-brown-height-how-tall-is-kane.html>Kane Brown Height How Tall is Kane?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./even-as-we-speak.html>Even as we speak</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./even-as-we-speak.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
